### TASK 1

You finish your working day and you are about to head off back home. Though, you need to go through the shops and buy some grocceries, such as milk, bread and vegies. Unfortunatelly, all the shops you visit do not have all items at the same time, and you want to buy everything in one place.

Draw an algorithm. Remember to be quite detailed and specific on actions

### TASK 2

```
You are a game developer, and you create a word guessing game. There are 2 players, one is a USER (humanbeing) and the second is a COMPUTER. You are, as a developer, provided with a Scrabble dictionary with all possible words with length from 3 to 25 (there are actually even larger words exist :)) ). USER enters the random number between 3 and 25 for the length of the word to be choosed, and the number of attempts, computer "chooses" the word of the specified length. USER starts guessing the word, letter by letter. COMPUTER takes all words with a specified length, and when received a letter, decrements the total left number of attempts, but eventually cuts words from list with that letter, saying that USER did not guess the letter in the word. After all attempts are used, COMPUTER shows the correct word to the USER.

Draw an algorithm. Think about possible errors that may occur during a game.
